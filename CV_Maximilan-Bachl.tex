%I was looking for a challenging and fascinating job where I can use my skills practically. Telecommunication technology and theoretical computer science are a topic which I am very interested in. Furthermore the C programming language is one of my favorite programming languages and I also have experience with functional programming languages like Haskell. So I think that \employer{} is a good opportunity for me and I am sure that I can contribute a lot. Thus I am applying at your institution.
%
%At the moment I am studying computer science at TU Berlin and I am in my fourth semester. Most of my skills and knowledge that I have about programming and algorithms I learnt by myself during hobby projects with friends and also on my own. If you want, you can also have a look at my projects on github at \url{https://github.com/conchulio} (although these are mostly web-based projects) and see what I am currently capable of. 
%
%If you are actually interested in me at the same level that I am interested in \employer{}, I can start working for you at the beginning of May. Because I am studying full-time I would prefer working around 10 hours a week.
%
%I am looking forward to your response and it would be a great pleasure for me to meet you in person.

%\cvitem{Short Abstract}{Packet-loss is a well-known problem for Voice-over-IP telephony due to the fact that the shared Internet infrastructure is used to transport media data. In this thesis the impact of packet-loss on the performance and subjective quality of a spatial audio reproduction system (3D audio with headphones) is investigated. Spatial audio is interesting for telephony conferencing as it enables humans to easily distinguish the position of sound sources. This so-called 'Cocktail party effect' can be exploited to make multi-party conferencing easier and mentally less demanding. \newline The two questions that are investigated in this thesis are if the localization of the audio sources and the subjective quality change under the condition of packet-loss.}

\subsection{Work experience}
\cventry{5.2013--5.2014}{Software Developer}{Fraunhofer Heinrich Hertz Institute}{Berlin}{}{In the last year of my Bachelor studies I worked at Fraunhofer Heinrich Hertz Institute. 
In my department (Wireless Networks) we developed a software-based LTE implementation.
My biggest tasks were to implement the demapper, descrambler and demodulator according to the LTE specifications. The demapper is the part that separates the big data stream that arrives from the mobile phone tower. I split up the control information and payload and analyzed it according to the LTE standard. The descrambler and demodulator converted the data to bits that could finally be interpreted. Also I developed a graphical front-end that plotted and visualized the extracted information. \\
I accomplished this task mainly using MATLAB and C.}
